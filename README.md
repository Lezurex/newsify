# Newsify

With Newsify users can search articles by its category. When he searches for a category the
headline and a link to the articles related to the category are displayed to the user.
Currently the information about the articles are gathered via the RSS api from SRF (Swiss Radio
and Television). If there is enough time left, we plan to offer a feature where the user can choose
the RSS feed or add a new one. Another optional feature would be, that the user is able to
categorize the articles manually.
